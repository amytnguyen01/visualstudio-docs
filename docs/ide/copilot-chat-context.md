# Get better answers with improved context in GitHub Copilot Chat

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

[**GitHub Copilot Chat**](visual-studio-github-copilot-chat.md) in Visual Studio enables you to get coding information and support, such as syntax, programming concepts, context-specific code help, test cases, debugging, and more, without leaving the IDE. With tight integration in Visual Studio, Copilot Chat understands what you're working on by gathering useful context data from Visual Studio. 

In this article, you'll learn about how to get better answers with improved context in Copilot Chat. [Slash commands](#use-slash-commands) and the new context experience features in Copilot Chat, such as [references](#control-context-with-references), [**Info used**](#know-the-context-used-by-copilot), and [threads](#organize-your-chat-conversations-with-threads) enable you to form great questions by scoping the intent and context.

Learn more about [AI-assisted development in Visual Studio](../ide/ai-assisted-development-visual-studio.md) and how to [use Copilot Chat in Visual Studio](../ide/visual-studio-github-copilot-chat.md#use-copilot-chat-in-visual-studio).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need:
+ Visual Studio 2022 [version 17.6](/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-history) or later
+ Active [subscription](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-copilot/about-billing-for-github-copilot) to [GitHub Copilot for Individuals](https://docs.github.com/copilot/overview-of-github-copilot/about-github-copilot-for-individuals) or [GitHub Copilot for Business](https://docs.github.com/copilot/overview-of-github-copilot/about-github-copilot-for-business)
+ [**GitHub Copilot** extension](visual-studio-github-copilot-extension.md#installation-instructions) in Visual Studio
+ [**GitHub Copilot Chat** extension](visual-studio-github-copilot-chat.md#install-the-visual-studio-extension) in Visual Studio

## Use slash commands

Slash commands in Copilot Chat help you set the intent quickly for common development tasks. By using specific slash commands to form your question, you can get better answers without having to write out long questions. 

You can use slash commands in a [chat window](visual-studio-github-copilot-chat.md#ask-questions-in-the-chat-window), or directly inline in the code that you're looking to modify, using [inline code assistance](visual-studio-github-copilot-chat.md#ask-questions-in-the-interactive-code-assistant). Commands that help modify or add to the code file you have open in the editor will work both in the inline code assistant and the chat windows whereas commands for more general coding questions work only in the chat pane.

| **Command** | **Usage** | **Chat window** | **Interactive code assistant** | **Example** |
|---------------------------|:--------------------:|:-----------------:|
| /askvs| Ask questions related to Visual Studio | Yes | No | /askvs How do I connect Visual Studio to a Git Repository?|
| /createtest| Create unit tests for the selected code| Yes | Yes | select desired code and enter /createtest |
| /doc| Add comments for specified or selected code | Yes | Yes | - /doc DeleteBasketAsync method in BasketService.cs</br> - select desired code and enter /doc|
| /explain | Explain the code | Yes | Yes | - /explain the AddItemToBasket method in BasketService.cs</br> - select desired code and enter /explain|
| /fix | Propose a fix for problems in the selected code | Yes | Yes | - /fix the SetQuantities method in BasketService.cs</br> - select desired code and enter /fix|
| /generate | Generate code to answer specified question | Yes | Yes | /generate code to add two numbers in Calculator.cs |
| /help | Get help on Copilot Chat | Yes | No | /help |
| /optimize | Analyze and improve running time of the selected code | Yes | Yes | - /optimize the AddItemToBasket method in BasketService.cs</br> - select desired code and enter /optimize|

## Context awareness and control

### Control context with references

You can ask your coding related questions in natural language and GitHub Copilot Chat will answer these in the context of the codebase open in Visual Studio. With references you can get more specific about the information you want Copilot to consider when answering your question. By selecting a specific context in your codebase, you're able to form better questions easily without having to write out or paste long pieces of information. Specifying the context also enables Copilot to provide you with more relevant answers.

:::image type="content" source="media/copilot-chat-context/copilot-chat-context-hash-reference.png" alt-text="Screenshot of references in Copilot Chat.":::

To easily reference a file, simply add a *#* symbol at the beginning of the file name. For example, if you have a file named *BasketService.cs*, refer to it in the chat as *#BasketService.cs*. Here are some examples of using references for context control:

| **Example** | **Context used by Copilot to form the question** |
|---------------------------|:--------------------:|
| What is the purpose of #MyFile.cs: 66-72?| Exact section of the file |
| Where are the tests in #BasketService.cs?| BasketService.cs |
| /explain the AddItemToBasket method in #BasketService.cs| AddItemToBasket method in BasketService.cs |

### Know the context used by Copilot

Copilot Chat will display the context it used after every result, so that you can tell what was taken into account when answering your question. When you ask a Copilot Chat a question and get a response in the chat window, an **Info used** dropdown appears below the response. The entries in the **Info used** dropdown list show you the context referenced by Copilot Chat to generate that response. This information can help you modify your question to get better and more relevant answers.

### Organize your chat conversations with threads 

If you’re using Copilot Chat extensively to ask questions as you code, you’ll find it helpful to organize your conversations in a way that keeps them on-topic. Copilot Chat for Visual Studio now provides an easy way to start new conversations to keep them focused on the task at hand, and keep the context clear so the answers are based on relevant historical context. 

You can start a new thread by selecting the **Create new thread** in the chat window.

You can select between multiple ongoing threads to provide the right historical context for your question.
